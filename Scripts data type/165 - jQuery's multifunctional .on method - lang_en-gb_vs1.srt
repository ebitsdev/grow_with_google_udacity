I oriented you through using
jQuery's on() method,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,010
and you spent some time researching
jQuery's methods...

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,050
that are shortcuts
for the on() method.

4
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:09,720
There's still another way...

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,240
to set up an event listener
jQuery's on() method.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,140
In the next section,
you'll learn about event delegation,

7
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:19,247
where jQuery watches one parent
element for events on any of its children.
