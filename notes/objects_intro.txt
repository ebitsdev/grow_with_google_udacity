Objects in Code
Objects in code

TIP: It’s worth noting that while we can represent real-world objects as JavaScript objects, the analogy does not always hold. This is a good starting place for thinking about the structure and purpose of objects, but as you continue your career as a developer, you’ll find that JavaScript objects can behave wildly different than real objects.

NOTE: typeof is an operator that returns the name of the data type that follows it:

typeof "hello" // returns "string"
typeof true // returns "boolean"
typeof [1, 2, 3] // returns "object" (Arrays are a type of object)
typeof function hello() { } // returns "function"
