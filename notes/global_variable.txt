Global Variables
Using global variables
So you might be wondering:

"Why wouldn't I always use global variables? Then, I would never need to use function arguments since ALL my functions would have access to EVERYTHING!"
Well... Global variables might seem like a convenient idea at first, especially when you're writing small scripts and programs, but there are many reasons why you shouldn't 
use them unless you have to. For instance, global variables can conflict with other global variables of the same name. Once your programs get larger and larger, it'll get harder and harder to keep track and prevent this from happening.
There are also other reasons you'll learn more about in more advanced courses. But for now, just work on minimizing the use of global variables as much as possible.
