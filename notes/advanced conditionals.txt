Hereâ€™s the list of all of the falsy values:
the Boolean value false
the null type
the undefined type
the number 0
the empty string ""
the odd value NaN (stands for "not a number", check out the NaN MDN article)
That's right, there are only six falsy values in all of JavaScript!

Ternary Operator

if we use "null" as a string then it is truthy just like when we use "1" as a string

TIP: Using if(isGoing) is the same as using if(isGoing === true). Alternatively, using if(!isGoing) is the same as using if(isGoing === false).

Ternary operator
The ternary operator provides you with a shortcut alternative for writing lengthy if...else statements.

conditional ? (if condition is true) : (if condition is false)
To use the ternary operator, first provide a conditional statement on the left-side of the ?. Then, between the ? and : write the code that would run if the condition is true and on the right-hand side of the : write the code that would run if the condition is false. For example, you can rewrite the example code above as:

var isGoing = true;
var color = isGoing ? "green" : "red";
console.log(color);
Prints: "green"

Using ternary statements in your code is completely optional. It just gives you another option for writing if...else statements.
