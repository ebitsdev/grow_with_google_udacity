Length
Array.length
You can find the length of an array by using its length property.

var donuts = ["glazed", "powdered", "sprinkled"];
console.log(donuts.length);
Prints: 3

To access the length property, type the name of the array, followed by a period . 
(youâ€™ll also use the period to access other properties and methods), and the word length. 
The length property will then return the number of elements in the array.

TIP: Strings have a length property too! You can use it to get the length of any string. 
For example, "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".length returns 34.
