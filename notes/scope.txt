Shadowing

The global variable x is incremented by 1. Since the global variable's original value was 1, and it was incremented by 1, console.log will print out 2.
The variable assignment inside the function addTwo() only has function scope, so its affect is not reflected outside the function.

QUESTION 1 OF 2
Without pasting into your console, what do you think this code will print out?

var x = 1;

function addTwo() {
  x = x + 2;
}

addTwo();
x = x + 1;
console.log(x);


Scope Recap
What you've learned so far:
If an identifier is declared in global scope, it's available everywhere.
If an identifier is declared in function scope, it's available in the function it was declared in (even in functions declared inside the function).
When trying to access an identifier, the JavaScript Engine will first look in the current function. If it doesn't find anything, it will continue to the next outer function to see if it can find the identifier there. It will keep doing this until it reaches the global scope.
Global identifiers are a bad idea. They can lead to bad variable names, conflicting variable names, and messy code.
