Splice
splice() is another handy method that allows you to add and remove elements from anywhere within an array.

While push() and pop() limit you to adding and removing elements from the end of an array, splice() lets you specify the index location to add new elements, as well as the number of elements you'd like to delete (if any).

var donuts = ["glazed", "chocolate frosted", "Boston creme", "glazed cruller"];
donuts.splice(1, 1, "chocolate cruller", "creme de leche"); // removes "chocolate frosted" at index 1 and adds "chocolate cruller" and "creme de leche" starting at index 1
Returns: ["chocolate frosted"]
donuts array: ["glazed", "chocolate cruller", "creme de leche", "Boston creme", "glazed cruller"]

The first argument represents the starting index from where you want to change the array, the second argument represents the numbers of elements you want to remove, and the remaining arguments represent the elements you want to add.
